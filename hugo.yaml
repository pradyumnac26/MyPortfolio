    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am Pradyumna (pronounced “Prad-You-Mna”), currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a profound passion for technology and a strong foundation in Software Development. I thrive on leading impactful projects and continuously seek knowledge and growth, particularly in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation and deliver tangible results. I am currently delving into Generative AI, earning AWS Certifications, and exploring GraphQL, Ruby on Rails, and Go.

      With 2.3 years of professional experience, I have held positions from Software Engineer to Release Manager. I conducted a 3-day workshop for over 30 employees at Societe Generale on good coding practices, Git, and .NET. In my free time, I enhance my skills by participating in coding contests and hackathons, and by reading technical blogs and papers. When i am away from keyboard, I enjoy playing sports, listening to music, reading books, traveling, and painting.
